/// An example of such a relationship is a grid-based game where each cell has at most
/// one occupant, and each occupant is in exactly one cell:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_121::AsymmetricOneToOne;
///
/// #[derive(AsymmetricOneToOne)]
/// #[target(Occupant)]
/// struct Cell(Entity);
///
/// #[derive(AsymmetricOneToOne)]
/// #[target(Cell)]
/// struct Occupant(Entity);

/// Note that in this example, while the `AsymmetricOneToOne` mechanism will enforce the 1:1 nature
/// of the relationship, it does not enforce that all occupants have a cell. It's up to the user to
/// be careful about removing the `Cell` component.
